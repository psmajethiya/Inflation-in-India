**Project type notes.** Predictive = you are trying to forecast or predict a quantity. Causal = you are trying to estimate the effect of a policy or intervention. Descriptive = you are measuring patterns or disparities without making a causal claim. The success threshold looks different for each type, so pick the one that fits your main question.

## 1. Problem and stakeholder
The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee sets the repo rate under a 4% CPI inflation target. During the 2022–23 surge, CPI inflation peaked around 7.8% YoY. The MPC's ex-post communication attributed the surge largely to external supply shocks (oil, wheat, fertiliser). We want to quantify, month-by-month, how much of observed CPI inflation over 2015–2025 is statistically attributable to monetary policy variables, external shocks, and domestic demand — as input to a hypothetical policy retrospective an MPC analyst would present to the board. Particular attention is paid to the 2022–23 inflation episode. Prior work (Dua and Goel, 2021) stops in 2017 and therefore omits COVID and the post-2020 inflation dynamics; our contribution is to extend this accounting to the recent period using flexible ML methods.

## 2. Main outcome variable
- **Name**: month-over-month CPI inflation, India, all-items
- **Unit**: percentage points (m/m)
- **Source**: MoSPI CPI release, all-India combined series (CPI_C_GEN)
- **Population / panel**: monthly observations, Jan 2015 – Dec 2025 (~132 months); train on Jan 2015 – Dec 2021, evaluate on Jan 2022 – Dec 2025 (48 months held-out)

---

## 3. Main quantitative success threshold

Out-of-sample RMSE on the 2022-01 to 2025-12 held-out slice must be at least 20% lower than the AR(1) baseline RMSE computed on the same slice, with a minimum absolute reduction of 0.05 percentage points per month.

---

## 4. Baseline to beat

AR(1) on m/m CPI inflation, fit on Jan 2015 – Dec 2021, evaluated on Jan 2022 – Dec 2025. We will compute this baseline RMSE before any model building and commit it to `outputs/baseline_metric.json`. A linear VECM (Dua-Goel-style with our variable set) is reported as a secondary baseline.

## 5. Falsifiable hypothesis

During the 2022-04 to 2023-03 window, the cumulative attribution assigned to external shocks (Brent + INR/USD) will exceed the cumulative attribution assigned to policy (repo rate) by at least 10 percentage points and will also exceed the cumulative attribution assigned to domestic demand (IIP). We impose a 10 percentage point margin to ensure that the dominance of external shocks is economically meaningful rather than driven by marginal differences in attribution.

## 6. Data sources and access plan

Most sources are open-access and require no login or API key. EPWRF access is available via institutional subscription.

MoSPI CPI (all-India combined, monthly):
Landing: https://www.mospi.gov.in/cpi
Access: downloaded from the eSankhyiki catalogue (CPI all-items, combined series, base 2012=100) and committed as data/cpi_clean.csv for reproducibility; loaded via pandas.
Login required: no.

EPWRF India Time Series — IIP (general index, monthly):
Landing: https://www.epwrfits.in/
Access: downloaded manually via institutional access (monthly general IIP index, base 2011–12 = 100).
Login required: yes (institutional subscription).
Mitigation: data exported as CSV and committed under data/iip_clean.csv for reproducibility.

RBI repo rate (monthly end-of-period):
Source: https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx
Access: constructed manually from RBI Monetary Policy press releases and committed as data/repo_clean.csv for reproducibility; loaded via pandas.
Login required: no.

FRED INR/USD exchange rate (monthly):
Endpoint: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=EXINUS
Access: downloaded from FRED and committed as data/fx_clean.csv for reproducibility; loaded via pandas.
Login required: no.

FRED Brent oil price (daily → monthly average):
Endpoint: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=DCOILBRENTEU
Access: downloaded from FRED, aggregated to monthly frequency, and committed as data/oil_clean.csv for reproducibility; loaded via pandas.
Login required: no.

(A probe cell for each source is included in notebooks/00_data_probe.ipynb.)

## 7. Scope limits

- We will **not** estimate a structural causal effect of monetary policy. Any policy-attribution number we report is predictive/associational, not causal.
- We will **not** produce forecasts beyond the sample period (Jan 2015 – Dec 2025).
- If time permits, we may include a **lightweight exploratory dashboard** for inspecting trends and attribution shares on the held-out window. It is optional, not part of the grading core, and will **not** be production-grade, include user authentication, or update in real time.
- We will **not** model food-price or core CPI sub-indices separately. All-items CPI is the only outcome.

---

## 8. Risks and fallback

- **Risk**: Double ML is likely too fragile for a small monthly sample with correlated macro regressors. **Fallback**: use a parsimonious regularized dynamic regression (ARX / ridge with lagged CPI, repo rate, oil, FX, and IIP), and report coefficient-based or scenario-based attribution rather than causal attribution.

---

## 9. Reproducibility checklist

Your final repo must satisfy all of these:

- [x] `uv run main.py` runs end-to-end in under 10 minutes on a clean machine with no manual intervention.
- [x] It writes `outputs/primary_metric.json` containing a single JSON object with at least `{"metric_name": "...", "value": <number>, "threshold": <number>, "passed": <bool>}`.
- [x] It writes `outputs/baseline_metric.json` in the same shape.
- [x] A `README.md` documents the commands and expected outputs in ≤ 20 lines.
- [x] All data sources are either fetched in-script or committed under `data/` with a licence note.

If you cannot commit to this, your project is probably still too broad. Talk to the instructor before proceeding.

## Sign-off

By submitting this charter, the team agrees that this is the plan the project will be graded against. The instructor will not penalize you just because the topic turns out to be difficult, as long as the project stays honest and within the approved scope.
